The files with .eddx extensions were created by a program called Edraw Max 7.6
(http://www.edrawsoft.com/). It looks and feels like Visio, but costs $99
(for 1 year of updates) or $149 (lifetime updates). There is a free 30-day
fully functional trial version available for download if you wish to markup
the .eddx files.
